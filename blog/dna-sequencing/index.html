            <h2>What is DNA Sequencing?</h2>
            <p><strong>DNA sequencing</strong> is the process of determining the precise order of nucleotides (A, T, G, C) in a DNA molecule. This "reading" of the genetic code has transformed biology, enabling us to understand genomes, diagnose diseases, solve crimes, trace ancestry, and engineer organisms.</p>

            <p>The history of sequencing is a story of increasingly clever chemistry and engineering, driving costs down and throughput up by orders of magnitude.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box-title">Sequencing Generations</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>First generation:</strong> Sanger sequencing (1977); reads ~1,000 bases per reaction</li>
                    <li><strong>Second generation:</strong> NGS/short-read (2005+); massively parallel; reads millions of short fragments</li>
                    <li><strong>Third generation:</strong> Long-read (2010+); reads thousands to millions of bases per molecule</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Before Sequencing: The Early Days</h2>
            <p>In 1953, Watson and Crick described DNA's double helix structure. But knowing the structure didn't reveal the sequence, the actual genetic "letters." For two decades, sequencing remained essentially impossible.</p>

            <p>Early methods were laborious. Ray Wu developed enzymatic approaches in the early 1970s but could only sequence short stretches. The field needed a breakthrough.</p>

            <h2>Frederick Sanger: The Dideoxy Method (1977)</h2>
            <p><strong>Frederick Sanger</strong> was a quiet British biochemist who had already won a Nobel Prize (1958) for sequencing the protein insulin. In the 1970s, he turned to DNA.</p>

            <h3>The Elegant Insight</h3>
            <p>Sanger's method, published in 1977, used a brilliant trick. He employed <strong>dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs)</strong>, modified nucleotides lacking the 3' hydroxyl group needed to form the next phosphodiester bond. When incorporated, they terminate chain elongation.<a href="#ref1" class="cite">[1]</a></p>

            <p>By running four reactions (each with a small proportion of one ddNTP: ddATP, ddTTP, ddGTP, or ddCTP), you generate a ladder of fragments ending at every occurrence of that base. Separating these fragments by size reveals the sequence.</p>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prime and extend:</strong> A primer binds to the template; DNA polymerase begins synthesis</li>
                <li><strong>Random termination:</strong> Occasionally, a ddNTP is incorporated instead of a normal dNTP, terminating that chain</li>
                <li><strong>Size separation:</strong> Gel electrophoresis separates fragments by length</li>
                <li><strong>Read the ladder:</strong> The sequence is read from the pattern of bands</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Sanger received his <strong>second Nobel Prize in 1980</strong>, one of only four people to win two Nobels.<a href="#ref4" class="cite">[4]</a></p>

            <h3>Automation</h3>
            <p>The original method used radioactive labels and manual reading of X-ray films. <strong>Leroy Hood</strong> and colleagues at Caltech automated the process using fluorescent labels (different colors for each base) and laser detection. This enabled automated DNA sequencers, machines that could sequence DNA continuously.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>"The development of methods to sequence DNA was perhaps the single most important technical advance in biological research in the last century."</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>The Human Genome Project (1990-2003)</h2>
            <p>The ultimate test of sequencing technology: decode the 3 billion base pairs of human DNA.</p>

            <p>Led by <strong>Francis Collins</strong> (NIH) and an international consortium, the public Human Genome Project used Sanger sequencing at massive scale. Parallel efforts by <strong>Craig Venter</strong> at Celera Genomics used a "shotgun" approach, sequencing random fragments and computationally assembling them.</p>

            <p>The project cost <strong>$2.7 billion</strong> and took 13 years. The draft sequence was announced in 2000 (in a joint announcement by Collins and Venter), with the "complete" sequence published in 2003.<a href="#ref2" class="cite">[2]</a></p>

            <h2>Next-Generation Sequencing (2005+)</h2>
            <p>Sanger sequencing, while revolutionary, had limitations: each reaction read one DNA fragment at a time. The next breakthrough was <strong>massively parallel sequencing</strong>.</p>

            <h3>The Key Innovation</h3>
            <p>Instead of reading one fragment per reaction, NGS platforms sequence millions of fragments simultaneously on a single chip. This parallelization, combined with clever biochemistry, increased throughput by orders of magnitude.</p>

            <h3>Major Platforms</h3>

            <h4>Illumina (Sequencing by Synthesis)</h4>
            <p>The dominant platform today. DNA fragments are attached to a flow cell surface, amplified into clusters, and sequenced by adding fluorescently labeled nucleotides one at a time. After each addition, a camera captures which base was incorporated at each cluster.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> High accuracy (~99.9%), high throughput, low cost per base</li>
                <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Short reads (150-300 bases), requires amplification</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Ion Torrent (Semiconductor Sequencing)</h4>
            <p>Detects hydrogen ions released during nucleotide incorporation. No optical system needed, as detection is purely electronic.</p>

            <h3>Short-Read Advantages and Limitations</h3>
            <p>NGS reads are short (100-300 bases for Illumina). For human genomes, this means sequencing is like shredding a book and reassembling it from overlapping fragments. Repetitive regions (common in genomes) are challenging to assemble correctly.</p>

            <h2>Third Generation: Long-Read Sequencing (2010+)</h2>
            <p>Long-read technologies can sequence individual DNA molecules for thousands to millions of bases, solving the assembly problem for repetitive regions.</p>

            <h3>Pacific Biosciences (PacBio)</h3>
            <p><strong>Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing</strong> watches a single DNA polymerase molecule incorporating fluorescent nucleotides in real time. Read lengths of 10,000-20,000+ bases are routine.</p>

            <h3>Oxford Nanopore</h3>
            <p>A truly revolutionary approach: DNA passes through a nanoscale pore, and the electrical current change as each base transits reveals the sequence. No optics, no amplification, no fluorescence.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MinION:</strong> A USB-stick-sized sequencer costing ~$1,000</li>
                <li><strong>Read length:</strong> Virtually unlimited; reads of >2 million bases achieved</li>
                <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Sequencing in the field, in space, even in the jungle</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Cost Revolution</h2>
            <p>The drop in sequencing cost is unprecedented in technology:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>2001:</strong> ~$100,000,000 per human genome</li>
                <li><strong>2007:</strong> ~$10,000,000</li>
                <li><strong>2014:</strong> ~$1,000</li>
                <li><strong>2024:</strong> ~$200</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This outpaced Moore's Law by orders of magnitude, driven by the revolution in NGS technology.<a href="#ref5" class="cite">[5]</a></p>
