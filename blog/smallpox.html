            <h2>What Was Smallpox?</h2>
            <p><strong>Smallpox</strong> was a devastating infectious disease caused by the <strong>variola virus</strong>. It existed in two forms: variola major (more severe, ~30% fatality) and variola minor (~1% fatality).<a href="#ref1" class="cite">[1]</a> The disease spread through respiratory droplets and contact with skin lesions or contaminated materials.</p>

            <p>Smallpox caused a distinctive rash that progressed from flat red spots to raised bumps, then fluid-filled blisters, and finally pus-filled pustules that crusted over. Survivors were often left with disfiguring scars; many were blinded.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box-title">Clinical Features</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Incubation:</strong> 7-19 days (average 12-14)</li>
                    <li><strong>Prodrome:</strong> High fever, malaise, severe body aches</li>
                    <li><strong>Rash:</strong> Centrifugal distribution (face, arms, legs more than trunk)</li>
                    <li><strong>Complications:</strong> Blindness, skin scarring, encephalitis, death</li>
                    <li><strong>Transmission:</strong> Respiratory droplets, direct contact, fomites</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>A Long History of Terror</h2>
            <p>Smallpox plagued humanity for at least 3,000 years. Evidence of smallpox-like rashes has been found on Egyptian mummies, including Ramses V (died 1157 BCE). The disease devastated populations across Asia, Europe, and Africa for millennia.</p>

            <p>When European colonizers brought smallpox to the Americas in the 15th and 16th centuries, the results were catastrophic. Indigenous populations, with no immunity, were decimated. Some historians estimate that <strong>90% of the indigenous population died</strong>, largely from infectious diseases led by smallpox. It was among the most devastating epidemiological disasters in human history.</p>

            <p>In 18th century Europe, smallpox killed an estimated <strong>400,000 people annually</strong> and was responsible for a third of all blindness. Even into the 20th century, it killed an estimated <strong>300 million people</strong>.<a href="#ref2" class="cite">[2]</a></p>

            <h2>The Birth of Vaccination</h2>
            <p>The concept of immunization against smallpox predates modern medicine. In China and India, <strong>variolation</strong>, deliberately exposing people to material from mild smallpox cases, had been practiced for centuries. The procedure was risky but effective, reducing mortality significantly.</p>

            <p>The breakthrough came in 1796 when English physician <strong>Edward Jenner</strong> observed that milkmaids who had contracted cowpox, a mild disease, seemed immune to smallpox.<a href="#ref4" class="cite">[4]</a> He tested his hypothesis by inoculating 8-year-old James Phipps with material from a cowpox lesion on a milkmaid's hand. Six weeks later, Jenner exposed the boy to smallpox. He didn't develop the disease.</p>

            <p>Jenner called his technique <strong>vaccination</strong> (from "vacca," Latin for cow). It was safer than variolation and became the foundation for modern immunology. Within years, vaccination spread across Europe and the Americas.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>"The annihilation of the smallpox, the most dreadful scourge of the human species, must be the final result of this practice."</p>
                <cite>- Edward Jenner, 1801</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>The Eradication Campaign</h2>
            <p>By the 20th century, smallpox had been eliminated from wealthy countries through vaccination. But it continued to devastate developing nations. In 1967, the World Health Organization launched the <strong>Intensified Smallpox Eradication Programme</strong>.</p>

            <p>The campaign faced enormous challenges: reaching remote populations, maintaining vaccine potency in tropical heat, overcoming political instability, and tracking cases in countries with minimal health infrastructure. Success required innovation:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bifurcated needle:</strong> A simple, cheap tool that reduced vaccine waste 4-fold</li>
                <li><strong>Freeze-dried vaccine:</strong> Stable without refrigeration in tropical climates</li>
                <li><strong>Ring vaccination:</strong> Vaccinating contacts of cases rather than entire populations</li>
                <li><strong>Surveillance-containment:</strong> Aggressively hunting down every case</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The last natural case of variola major occurred in <strong>Bangladesh in October 1975</strong>. The last natural case of variola minor occurred in <strong>Somalia in October 1977</strong>. On May 8, 1980, the World Health Assembly declared smallpox officially eradicated, the first (and still only) human disease to achieve this milestone.<a href="#ref1" class="cite">[1]</a></p>

            <h2>Key Figures</h2>
            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box-title">Heroes of Eradication</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>D.A. Henderson:</strong> American physician who led the WHO eradication program</li>
                    <li><strong>William Foege:</strong> Developed the surveillance-containment strategy</li>
                    <li><strong>Isao Arita:</strong> Chief of the smallpox eradication unit at WHO</li>
                    <li><strong>Thousands of local health workers:</strong> Vaccinated millions, tracked cases in remote areas</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Lessons for Today</h2>
            <p>The eradication of smallpox offers crucial lessons:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Eradication is possible:</strong> With political will, resources, and the right tools</li>
                <li><strong>Innovation matters:</strong> Simple technologies like the bifurcated needle were game-changers</li>
                <li><strong>Surveillance is key:</strong> Finding and containing cases is as important as vaccination</li>
                <li><strong>Global cooperation works:</strong> Even Cold War rivals collaborated on eradication</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Today, smallpox exists only in two WHO-authorized laboratories in the United States and Russia. Debates continue about whether these stocks should be destroyed. Meanwhile, the virus's potential use as a bioweapon remains a security concern, one reason why some countries maintain smallpox vaccine stockpiles.</p>

            <h2>The Only One?</h2>
            <p>Despite decades of effort, smallpox remains the only human disease ever eradicated. Polio is close, but challenges persist. Measles could theoretically be eradicated but vaccine hesitancy has caused resurgences.</p>

            <p>Smallpox had unique characteristics favoring eradication: no animal reservoir, visible symptoms, one serotype, lifelong immunity from infection or vaccination. Other diseases are more complex. But the lesson stands: with sufficient commitment, even ancient scourges can be defeated.</p>
