            <h2>What is Polio?</h2>
            <p>Poliomyelitis, commonly known as polio, is a highly infectious viral disease caused by the <strong>poliovirus</strong>. The virus primarily spreads through the fecal-oral route, typically through contaminated water or food in areas with poor sanitation. While most infections are asymptomatic or cause mild flu-like symptoms, approximately 1 in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis.<a href="#ref1" class="cite">[1]</a></p>

            <p>The virus targets motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem, destroying the nerve cells that control muscle movement. When enough neurons are killed, the result is permanent muscle weakness or complete paralysis—most commonly affecting the legs, but sometimes the arms or respiratory muscles.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box-title">Key Symptoms</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Non-paralytic polio:</strong> Fever, sore throat, headache, vomiting, fatigue, neck stiffness</li>
                    <li><strong>Paralytic polio:</strong> Sudden onset of weakness, loss of reflexes, severe muscle pain, flaccid paralysis</li>
                    <li><strong>Post-polio syndrome:</strong> New weakness and fatigue decades after initial infection</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>A Brief History</h2>
            <p>Polio has affected humans for thousands of years—ancient Egyptian carvings depict people with withered limbs characteristic of the disease. However, polio became epidemic only in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, paradoxically due to <strong>improved sanitation</strong>.</p>

            <p>Before modern sanitation, infants were exposed to poliovirus early in life while still protected by maternal antibodies. As sanitation improved, children encountered the virus later, without this protection, leading to more severe outcomes.</p>

            <p>The terror of polio reached its peak in the 1940s and 1950s. In 1952, the United States saw nearly <strong>58,000 cases</strong>, with over 3,000 deaths and 21,000 cases of paralysis.<a href="#ref4" class="cite">[4]</a> Swimming pools closed, movie theaters emptied, and parents kept children indoors during "polio season."</p>

            <h2>The Vaccine Heroes</h2>
            <h3>Jonas Salk (1914-1995)</h3>
            <p>In 1955, Jonas Salk announced the successful development of the first polio vaccine—an <strong>inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV)</strong> using killed virus. The vaccine was declared safe and effective after one of the largest clinical trials in history, involving 1.8 million children known as "Polio Pioneers."</p>

            <p>When asked who owned the patent, Salk famously replied: <em>"The people. Could you patent the sun?"</em></p>

            <h3>Albert Sabin (1906-1993)</h3>
            <p>Albert Sabin developed the <strong>oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV)</strong>, which used weakened live virus. Licensed in 1961, OPV had significant advantages: it was cheaper, easier to administer (no needles), and provided better intestinal immunity, reducing transmission. OPV became the primary tool for global eradication efforts.</p>

            <h2>The Global Eradication Initiative</h2>
            <p>In 1988, the World Health Assembly launched the <strong>Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI)</strong>, one of the largest public health initiatives in history.<a href="#ref2" class="cite">[2]</a> At the time, polio paralyzed more than 350,000 children annually across 125 endemic countries.</p>

            <p>Through massive vaccination campaigns, surveillance networks, and community health workers, wild poliovirus cases have been reduced by over 99.9%. Today, only <strong>Afghanistan and Pakistan</strong> remain endemic for wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1). Types 2 and 3 have been certified eradicated.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box-title">Eradication Milestones</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1994:</strong> Americas certified polio-free</li>
                    <li><strong>2000:</strong> Western Pacific certified polio-free</li>
                    <li><strong>2002:</strong> Europe certified polio-free</li>
                    <li><strong>2014:</strong> Southeast Asia certified polio-free</li>
                    <li><strong>2020:</strong> Africa certified wild polio-free</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Challenges Remaining</h2>
            <p>Despite remarkable progress, eradication faces significant challenges. In Afghanistan and Pakistan, conflict, political instability, and vaccine hesitancy have allowed the virus to persist. Health workers have been targeted, and some communities remain inaccessible.</p>

            <p>A newer challenge is <strong>circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV)</strong>. In rare cases, the weakened virus in OPV can mutate and regain the ability to cause paralysis. In under-immunized populations, these vaccine-derived strains can circulate and cause outbreaks. In 2023, cVDPV cases actually outnumbered wild poliovirus cases.</p>

            <p>To address this, a new <strong>novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2)</strong> was developed with additional genetic modifications to prevent reversion to a harmful form.</p>

            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            <p>There is no cure for polio. Treatment is supportive: bed rest, pain relievers, physical therapy, and in severe cases, mechanical ventilation for respiratory paralysis. The focus remains on prevention through vaccination.</p>

            <p>The <strong>iron lung</strong>—a negative pressure ventilator that encased patients' bodies—became an iconic symbol of the polio era. At the peak of the epidemics, hospital wards were filled with rows of these machines keeping paralyzed patients alive.</p>

            <h2>Why Eradication Matters</h2>
            <p>Eradicating polio would be only the second time humanity has eliminated a human disease (after smallpox in 1980). Beyond ending suffering, eradication would save an estimated <strong>$40-50 billion</strong> in healthcare costs over the next 20 years.<a href="#ref2" class="cite">[2]</a></p>

            <p>We are closer than ever. The infrastructure built for polio eradication—surveillance networks, cold chains, trained health workers—has also been instrumental in fighting other diseases, including COVID-19.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>"We are at a critical juncture. The world has the tools, knowledge, and commitment to end polio. Failure is not an option."</p>
            </blockquote>
