            <h2>What is Alzheimer's Disease?</h2>
            <p><strong>Alzheimer's disease</strong> is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that destroys memory and cognitive function. It's the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60-70% of cases.<a href="#ref2" class="cite">[2]</a> The disease slowly erases a person's memories, personality, and ability to function independently.</p>

            <p>Alzheimer's is characterized by two pathological hallmarks in the brain: <strong>amyloid plaques</strong> (clumps of beta-amyloid protein between neurons) and <strong>neurofibrillary tangles</strong> (twisted fibers of tau protein inside neurons). These accumulate over decades, eventually causing widespread neuronal death and brain atrophy.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box-title">Stages of Alzheimer's</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Preclinical:</strong> Brain changes occurring, no symptoms (can last 20+ years)</li>
                    <li><strong>Mild Cognitive Impairment:</strong> Memory lapses, but independence maintained</li>
                    <li><strong>Mild Alzheimer's:</strong> Memory loss, word-finding difficulty, getting lost</li>
                    <li><strong>Moderate:</strong> Confusion, behavior changes, need for assistance</li>
                    <li><strong>Severe:</strong> Loss of communication, total dependence, eventual death</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Discovery: Auguste Deter (1901-1906)</h2>
            <p>In November 1901, a 51-year-old woman named <strong>Auguste Deter</strong> was admitted to a Frankfurt asylum. She had progressive memory loss, confusion, paranoia, and could not perform basic tasks. Her physician, <strong>Alois Alzheimer</strong>, was intrigued by her case, as dementia this severe was unusual in someone so young.</p>

            <p>Auguste died in 1906. Alzheimer obtained her brain and examined it under a microscope using newly developed silver staining techniques. He found something remarkable: the cortex was riddled with abnormal deposits (plaques) and tangled fibers inside neurons (tangles).</p>

            <p>In November 1906, Alzheimer presented his findings at a conference. The audience was unimpressed. But his mentor, <strong>Emil Kraepelin</strong>, recognized the significance and named the condition "Alzheimer's disease" in his influential 1910 psychiatry textbook.<a href="#ref1" class="cite">[1]</a></p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>"Her memory is seriously impaired. If objects are shown to her, she names them correctly, but almost immediately afterwards has forgotten everything."</p>
                <cite>- Alois Alzheimer, describing Auguste Deter, 1901</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>The Amyloid Hypothesis</h2>
            <p>For decades, Alzheimer's was considered a normal part of aging. That changed in the 1980s-90s when researchers identified the proteins in plaques (beta-amyloid) and tangles (tau).</p>

            <p>The <strong>amyloid hypothesis</strong> proposed that accumulation of beta-amyloid triggers the disease cascade. This was supported by genetic discoveries: mutations in genes like APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 cause early-onset familial Alzheimer's, and all increase amyloid production.</p>

            <p>For 30 years, the amyloid hypothesis dominated research, driving billions in drug development. Yet every clinical trial targeting amyloid failed, until recently.</p>

            <h2>The Drug Development Graveyard</h2>
            <p>Alzheimer's drug development has been devastatingly unsuccessful. Over 100 drugs have failed in clinical trials. Theories for the failures include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Too late intervention:</strong> By the time symptoms appear, extensive damage has occurred</li>
                <li><strong>Wrong target:</strong> Maybe amyloid isn't the cause, just a byproduct</li>
                <li><strong>Poor trial design:</strong> Difficulty measuring meaningful outcomes</li>
                <li><strong>Disease complexity:</strong> Multiple pathways may be involved</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The only approved treatments for decades were cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine) and memantine, drugs that modestly improve symptoms but don't slow disease progression.</p>

            <h2>New Treatments: Hope or Hype? (2021-present)</h2>
            <p>In 2021, the FDA controversially approved <strong>aducanumab (Aduhelm)</strong>, an amyloid-clearing antibody, despite equivocal clinical trial results. Many experts criticized the decision; Medicare limited coverage.</p>

            <p>In 2023, <strong>lecanemab (Leqembi)</strong> became the first Alzheimer's drug to show clear evidence of slowing cognitive decline (by 27% over 18 months) while also clearing amyloid plaques.<a href="#ref3" class="cite">[3]</a> It was followed by <strong>donanemab</strong> with similar results.</p>

            <p>These drugs represent genuine progress but come with caveats:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Modest benefit:</strong> Slowing, not stopping, decline</li>
                <li><strong>Safety risks:</strong> Brain swelling and microbleeds (ARIA) in ~20-35%</li>
                <li><strong>High cost:</strong> ~$26,500/year for lecanemab</li>
                <li><strong>Burdensome:</strong> IV infusions, frequent MRI monitoring</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Risk Factors and Prevention</h2>
            <p>About 40% of dementia cases may be preventable through lifestyle modification:<a href="#ref4" class="cite">[4]</a></p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box-title">Modifiable Risk Factors</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Education:</strong> Lower education increases risk</li>
                    <li><strong>Hearing loss:</strong> Untreated hearing loss in midlife</li>
                    <li><strong>Hypertension:</strong> Especially in midlife</li>
                    <li><strong>Obesity and diabetes:</strong> Metabolic syndrome</li>
                    <li><strong>Physical inactivity:</strong> Exercise is protective</li>
                    <li><strong>Social isolation:</strong> Loneliness increases risk</li>
                    <li><strong>Smoking and excess alcohol:</strong> Both detrimental</li>
                    <li><strong>Depression:</strong> May be risk factor or early symptom</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>The strongest non-modifiable risk factor is <strong>age</strong>. After 65, risk doubles every 5 years. The <strong>APOE4</strong> gene variant increases risk 3-15 fold but isn't deterministic.</p>

            <h2>The Burden on Caregivers</h2>
            <p>Alzheimer's devastates not just patients but families. As cognitive and physical function decline, patients require increasing care, eventually needing round-the-clock supervision.</p>

            <p>Family caregivers (often adult children or spouses) provide an estimated <strong>$339 billion</strong> in unpaid care annually in the US alone.<a href="#ref5" class="cite">[5]</a> Caregiver stress is immense: higher rates of depression, health problems, and even mortality.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>"The longest goodbye." Many caregivers grieve for years as they watch their loved one slowly disappear, long before physical death.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>The Future</h2>
            <p>Research priorities include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Earlier intervention:</strong> Treating during preclinical phase before damage</li>
                <li><strong>Biomarker development:</strong> Blood tests to detect disease early</li>
                <li><strong>Tau-targeting therapies:</strong> Tau may be more closely linked to symptoms than amyloid</li>
                <li><strong>Combination approaches:</strong> Targeting multiple pathways</li>
                <li><strong>Prevention trials:</strong> Can we delay or prevent onset in high-risk people?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>As populations age globally, Alzheimer's cases are projected to triple by 2050. Finding effective treatments isn't just a medical priority; it's an economic and social imperative.</p>
