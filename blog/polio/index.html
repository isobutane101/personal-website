            <h2>What is Polio?</h2>
            <p>Poliomyelitis, commonly known as polio, is a highly infectious viral disease caused by the <strong>poliovirus</strong>. The virus primarily spreads through the fecal-oral route, typically through contaminated water or food in areas with poor sanitation. While most infections are asymptomatic or cause mild flu-like symptoms, approximately 1 in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis.<a href="#ref1" class="cite">[1]</a></p>

            <p>The virus targets motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem, destroying the nerve cells that control muscle movement. When enough neurons are killed, the result is permanent muscle weakness or complete paralysis, most commonly affecting the legs, but sometimes the arms or respiratory muscles.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box-title">Key Symptoms</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Non-paralytic polio:</strong> Fever, sore throat, headache, vomiting, fatigue, neck stiffness</li>
                    <li><strong>Paralytic polio:</strong> Sudden onset of weakness, loss of reflexes, severe muscle pain, flaccid paralysis</li>
                    <li><strong>Post-polio syndrome:</strong> New weakness and fatigue decades after initial infection</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>A Brief History</h2>
            <p>Polio has affected humans for thousands of years. Ancient Egyptian carvings depict people with withered limbs characteristic of the disease. However, polio became epidemic only in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, paradoxically due to <strong>improved sanitation</strong>.</p>

            <p>Before modern sanitation, infants were exposed to poliovirus early in life while still protected by maternal antibodies. As sanitation improved, children encountered the virus later, without this protection, leading to more severe outcomes.</p>

            <p>The terror of polio reached its peak in the 1940s and 1950s. In 1952, the United States saw nearly <strong>58,000 cases</strong>, with over 3,000 deaths and 21,000 cases of paralysis.<a href="#ref4" class="cite">[4]</a> Swimming pools closed, movie theaters emptied, and parents kept children indoors during "polio season."</p>

            <h2>The Vaccine Heroes: Salk vs. Sabin</h2>
            <p>The development of polio vaccines is one of medicine's greatest triumphs, but also one of its most fascinating rivalries. Two scientists, using fundamentally different approaches, each created vaccines that would save millions of lives.</p>

            <h3>Jonas Salk and the Inactivated Vaccine (IPV)</h3>
            <p>In 1955, Jonas Salk announced the successful development of the first polio vaccine, an <strong>inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV)</strong> using virus killed with formaldehyde. The vaccine was declared safe and effective after one of the largest clinical trials in history, involving 1.8 million children known as "Polio Pioneers."<a href="#ref4" class="cite">[4]</a></p>

            <p>When asked who owned the patent, Salk famously replied: <em>"The people. Could you patent the sun?"</em></p>

            <p>IPV's advantages: it cannot cause polio (the virus is dead), provides excellent protection against paralysis, and is extremely safe. Its disadvantages: requires injection, more expensive to produce, and provides less intestinal immunity, meaning vaccinated individuals can still carry and transmit wild virus.</p>

            <h3>Albert Sabin and the Oral Vaccine (OPV)</h3>
            <p>Albert Sabin took a different approach, developing an <strong>oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV)</strong> using live but weakened (attenuated) virus. Licensed in 1961, OPV had compelling advantages for mass vaccination campaigns:</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box-title">OPV vs. IPV: Key Differences</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Administration:</strong> OPV is oral drops; IPV requires injection</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost:</strong> OPV ~$0.10-0.20/dose; IPV ~$1-3/dose</li>
                    <li><strong>Intestinal immunity:</strong> OPV provides strong gut immunity, reducing transmission; IPV provides less</li>
                    <li><strong>Herd immunity:</strong> OPV-vaccinated individuals shed attenuated virus, passively immunizing contacts</li>
                    <li><strong>Safety:</strong> IPV cannot cause polio; OPV very rarely can (see below)</li>
                    <li><strong>Cold chain:</strong> Both require refrigeration; OPV more heat-sensitive</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>The rivalry between Salk and Sabin was intense and often bitter. Sabin dismissed Salk's killed vaccine as inferior; Salk resented Sabin's vaccine becoming the global standard. Both saved countless lives.</p>

            <h2>The Global Eradication Initiative</h2>
            <p>In 1988, the World Health Assembly launched the <strong>Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI)</strong>, one of the largest public health initiatives in history.<a href="#ref2" class="cite">[2]</a> At the time, polio paralyzed more than 350,000 children annually across 125 endemic countries.</p>

            <p>Through massive vaccination campaigns, surveillance networks, and community health workers, wild poliovirus cases have been reduced by over 99.9%. Today, only <strong>Afghanistan and Pakistan</strong> remain endemic for wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1). Types 2 and 3 have been certified eradicated.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box-title">Eradication Milestones</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1994:</strong> Americas certified polio-free</li>
                    <li><strong>2000:</strong> Western Pacific certified polio-free</li>
                    <li><strong>2002:</strong> Europe certified polio-free</li>
                    <li><strong>2014:</strong> Southeast Asia certified polio-free</li>
                    <li><strong>2020:</strong> Africa certified wild polio-free</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Challenges Remaining</h2>
            <p>Despite remarkable progress, eradication faces significant challenges. In Afghanistan and Pakistan, conflict, political instability, and vaccine hesitancy have allowed wild poliovirus to persist. Health workers have been targeted and killed, and some communities remain inaccessible.</p>

            <h2>The Vaccine-Derived Polio Problem</h2>
            <p>Perhaps the cruelest irony in the polio story is that the very vaccine responsible for near-eradication has become a source of new cases. The attenuated virus in OPV can, in rare circumstances, mutate back toward virulence.<a href="#ref5" class="cite">[5]</a></p>

            <p>There are two distinct problems:</p>

            <h3>Vaccine-Associated Paralytic Polio (VAPP)</h3>
            <p>In approximately 1 in 2.7 million first doses, the weakened OPV virus causes paralysis in the vaccine recipient or a close contact. This is extraordinarily rare, but in a world with little wild polio, VAPP became the main source of vaccine-related paralysis. The United States switched exclusively to IPV in 2000 for this reason.</p>

            <h3>Circulating Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus (cVDPV)</h3>
            <p>More problematic is when OPV virus circulates in under-immunized populations long enough to mutate and regain wild-type virulence. These <strong>circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs)</strong> can then cause outbreaks of paralytic polio.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box-title">How cVDPV Emerges</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>OPV administered:</strong> Vaccinated child sheds attenuated virus in stool for weeks</li>
                    <li><strong>Transmission:</strong> In areas with poor sanitation, shed virus spreads to others</li>
                    <li><strong>Mutation:</strong> If circulation continues long enough (typically 12+ months), the virus can revert to neurovirulent form</li>
                    <li><strong>Outbreak:</strong> In under-immunized populations, reverted virus causes paralysis</li>
                    <li><strong>Key point:</strong> cVDPV only emerges where vaccination coverage is low; well-immunized populations are protected</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>The tragic paradox: <strong>in 2023, vaccine-derived polio cases outnumbered wild polio cases</strong>. The tool of eradication had become a source of the disease. This occurs primarily with type 2 poliovirus. Wild type 2 was eradicated in 2015, but cVDPV2 continues to cause outbreaks in Africa and elsewhere.</p>

            <h3>The Solution: Novel OPV</h3>
            <p>To address this, scientists developed <strong>novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2)</strong> with additional genetic modifications that make reversion to virulence far less likely. Deployed since 2021 under WHO emergency use authorization, nOPV2 represents an attempt to maintain OPV's advantages while eliminating its greatest liability.</p>

            <p>The endgame strategy involves eventually replacing all OPV with IPV globally, but IPV's higher cost and logistical challenges make this difficult in the poorest regions where polio persists.</p>

            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            <p>There is no cure for polio. Treatment is supportive: bed rest, pain relievers, physical therapy, and in severe cases, mechanical ventilation for respiratory paralysis. The focus remains on prevention through vaccination.</p>

            <p>The <strong>iron lung</strong>, a negative pressure ventilator that encased patients' bodies, became an iconic symbol of the polio era. At the peak of the epidemics, hospital wards were filled with rows of these machines keeping paralyzed patients alive.</p>

            <h2>Why Eradication Matters</h2>
            <p>Eradicating polio would be only the second time humanity has eliminated a human disease (after smallpox in 1980). Beyond ending suffering, eradication would save an estimated <strong>$40-50 billion</strong> in healthcare costs over the next 20 years.<a href="#ref2" class="cite">[2]</a></p>

            <p>We are closer than ever. The infrastructure built for polio eradication (surveillance networks, cold chains, trained health workers) has also been instrumental in fighting other diseases, including COVID-19.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>"We are at a critical juncture. The world has the tools, knowledge, and commitment to end polio. Failure is not an option."</p>
            </blockquote>
