            <h2>What is Cystic Fibrosis?</h2>
            <p><strong>Cystic fibrosis (CF)</strong> is an inherited disorder that causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs, digestive system, and other organs. It's caused by mutations in the <strong>CFTR gene</strong>, which codes for a chloride channel protein essential for regulating fluid and mucus consistency.</p>

            <p>When CFTR doesn't work properly, secretions throughout the body become thick and viscous, leading to chronic lung infections, pancreatic insufficiency, and progressive organ damage.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <div class="info-box-title">Key Features</div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> Autosomal recessive (both parents must be carriers)</li>
                    <li><strong>Carrier frequency:</strong> 1 in 25-30 in Caucasian populations</li>
                    <li><strong>Incidence:</strong> ~1 in 2,500-3,500 Caucasian births</li>
                    <li><strong>Most common mutation:</strong> F508del (~70% of CF chromosomes)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Discovery: "Woe to the Child..." (1938-1989)</h2>
            <p>CF was first described as a distinct disease in 1938 by pathologist <strong>Dorothy Andersen</strong> at Columbia University.<a href="#ref5" class="cite">[5]</a> She identified the condition through autopsies of malnourished infants with pancreatic damage.</p>

            <p>An earlier clue came from European folklore: "Woe to the child who tastes salty from a kiss on the brow, for he is cursed and soon must die." This reflected the high salt content in CF patients' sweat, later used as a diagnostic test.</p>

            <p>In 1989, after an intense international race, three research groups led by <strong>Lap-Chee Tsui</strong>, <strong>Francis Collins</strong> (later NIH director), and <strong>John Riordan</strong> identified the CFTR gene on chromosome 7.<a href="#ref1" class="cite">[1]</a> The most common mutation, <strong>F508del</strong>, deletes a single phenylalanine amino acid, enough to cause severe disease.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>"Finding the gene was just the beginning. We had to understand what the protein does, why mutations cause disease, and how to fix it."</p>
                <cite>- Francis Collins</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>How CF Damages the Body</h2>
            <p>CFTR functions as a chloride channel, regulating the flow of salt and water across cell membranes. Without functional CFTR:</p>

            <h3>Lungs</h3>
            <p>Thick, dehydrated mucus accumulates, becoming a breeding ground for bacteria. Chronic infections, particularly <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, cause progressive lung damage. Lung disease is the primary cause of death in CF.</p>

            <h3>Pancreas</h3>
            <p>Thick secretions block pancreatic ducts, preventing digestive enzymes from reaching the intestine. About 85% of CF patients have pancreatic insufficiency, requiring enzyme supplements with every meal to digest food and absorb nutrients.</p>

            <h3>Other Systems</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Liver:</strong> Bile duct obstruction can cause cirrhosis</li>
                <li><strong>Intestines:</strong> Blockage (meconium ileus in newborns, DIOS in adults)</li>
                <li><strong>Sinuses:</strong> Chronic sinusitis and nasal polyps</li>
                <li><strong>Fertility:</strong> Most males are infertile (absent vas deferens)</li>
                <li><strong>Bones:</strong> Osteoporosis from malnutrition and inflammation</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Traditional Treatment</h2>
            <p>Before CFTR modulators, CF treatment focused on managing symptoms:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Airway clearance:</strong> Chest physiotherapy, oscillating devices, exercise</li>
                <li><strong>Mucolytics:</strong> DNase (Pulmozyme), hypertonic saline</li>
                <li><strong>Antibiotics:</strong> Inhaled and systemic, often for months at a time</li>
                <li><strong>Pancreatic enzymes:</strong> With every meal and snack</li>
                <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> High-calorie diet to combat malabsorption</li>
                <li><strong>Lung transplant:</strong> For end-stage lung disease</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These treatments improved survival dramatically, from a life expectancy of 5 years in the 1960s to 40+ years by 2010, but they could not address the underlying defect.</p>

            <h2>The CFTR Modulator Revolution</h2>
            <p>The discovery of the CFTR gene opened the possibility of treating the root cause. It took two decades, but the results transformed CF care.</p>

            <h3>Ivacaftor (Kalydeco) - 2012</h3>
            <p>The first breakthrough came from <strong>Vertex Pharmaceuticals</strong>. Ivacaftor is a "potentiator" that helps defective CFTR channels that reach the cell surface to open properly. It works for the G551D mutation and others (~5% of patients).</p>

            <p>Clinical trials showed remarkable results: lung function improved by 10+ percentage points, sweat chloride normalized, and patients gained weight.<a href="#ref2" class="cite">[2]</a> For the first time, a drug addressed the fundamental defect.</p>

            <h3>Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor (Orkambi) - 2015</h3>
            <p>For F508del, the most common mutation, the protein is misfolded and destroyed before reaching the cell surface. "Correctors" like lumacaftor help the protein fold correctly. Combined with ivacaftor, Orkambi offered modest benefits for F508del homozygotes.</p>

            <h3>Elexacaftor/Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (Trikafta) - 2019</h3>
            <p>The game-changer. This triple combination (two correctors plus a potentiator) dramatically improves lung function, reduces exacerbations, and improves quality of life for patients with at least one F508del mutation (<strong>~90% of CF patients</strong>).<a href="#ref3" class="cite">[3]</a></p>

            <p>Patients have described it as "getting their lives back." Many have come off transplant lists. Sweat chloride levels approach normal. The drug costs over $300,000/year in the US, sparking debates about drug pricing.</p>

            <h2>The Future</h2>
            <p>CFTR modulators are transformative but not a cure. Challenges remain:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>~10% of patients</strong> have mutations not responsive to current modulators</li>
                <li><strong>Existing lung damage</strong> is not reversed</li>
                <li><strong>Cost and access</strong> remain barriers globally</li>
                <li><strong>Long-term effects</strong> are still being studied</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Emerging approaches include gene therapy, mRNA therapy, and gene editing to correct CFTR mutations at the DNA level. The goal: a one-time treatment that provides a functional CFTR gene.</p>

            <h2>A Triumph of Molecular Medicine</h2>
            <p>CF exemplifies the promise of genomic medicine:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Identify the gene causing disease</li>
                <li>Understand the protein's function</li>
                <li>Develop drugs targeting the specific defect</li>
                <li>Match patients to treatments based on their mutations</li>
            </ol>

            <p>For families who lost children to CF in earlier decades, watching patients today live into middle age with good lung function is bittersweet. The science came too late for many, but it offers hope for all those who follow.</p>
